
## Cancer Marker Analysis using PCA and GMM Clustering

This project analyses cancer biomarker data before and after drug treatment to evaluate the effectiveness of a hypothetical new cancer drug. The analysis includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis - including histograms, boxplots and correlation heatmaps of the marker data
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify the most imoprtant components that explain the variance in the data
- Clustering Analysis: a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is applied to the PCA-transformed data to identify clusters and separate the patients that showed improvement from those who did not
- Interactive Widgets to allow the user to explore different aspects of the analysis.
